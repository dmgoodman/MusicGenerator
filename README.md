# MusicGenerator - COS 401 Final Project
## About

Using MIDI audio files of piano compositions by classical composers, such as Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Mozart, and Schubert, we generated new MIDI audio files using a Hidden Markov Model. Our training data consists of some of the most famous single-instrument compositions of our chosen composers in the MIDI audio format. By observing the frequencies and positions of different notes/tempos in these pieces, we generate MIDI audio files de novo that take into account the styles and chord progressions of established, classical music. These generated files can be played using an [online MIDI sequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net/import).
