# MusicGenerator - COS 401 Final Project
## About

Using MIDI audio files of piano compositions by classical composers, such as Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Mozart, and Schubert, we generated new MIDI audio files using multiple orders of Markov Models. Our training data consists of some of the most famous single-instrument compositions of our chosen composers in the MIDI audio format. By observing the frequencies and positions of different notes/tempos in these pieces, we generate MIDI audio files de novo that take into account the styles and chord progressions of established, classical music. We test multiple orders of the Markov Model to determine how far back in a piece of music we must look to determine the next note as certain music chord/note progressions are often less appealing than others. These generated files can be played using an [online MIDI sequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net/import).
